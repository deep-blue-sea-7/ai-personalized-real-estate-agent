    "# HomeMatch: The AI Personalized Real Estate Agent \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## *About*\n",
    "\n",
    "This application leverages large language models (LLMs) and vector databases to transform standard real estate listings into personalized narratives that resonate with potential buyers' unique preferences and needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## *High level process description*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <u>Step 1: Setting Up the Python Application</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "Install necessary packages: \n",
    "- LLM library: OpenAI's GPT\n",
    "- LangChain\n",
    "- Vector database package: ChromaDB\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <u>Step 2: Generating Real Estate Listings</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "Generate real estate listings using a Large Language Model through creating prompts for the LLM to produce descriptions of various properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "These listings will be used to populate the database for testing and development of the HomeMatch application.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <u>Step 3: Storing Listings in a Vector Database</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialize and configure ChromaDB vector database to store the real estate listings, the convert the LLM-generated listings into suitable embeddings that capture the semantic content of each listing, and store these embeddings in the vector database.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <u>Step 4: Building the User Preference Interface</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "Collect buyer preferences, such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, location, and other specific requirements from a set of questions. The questions/answers can be hard-coded in the buyer preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement logic to interpret and structure these preferences for querying the vector database.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <u>Step 5: Searching Based on Preferences</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement Semantic Search: Use the structured buyer preferences to perform a semantic search on the vector database, retrieving listings that most closely match the user's requirements.\n",
    "Listing Retrieval Logic: Fine-tune the retrieval algorithm to ensure that the most relevant listings are selected based on the semantic closeness to the buyer’s preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <u>Step 6: Personalizing Listing Descriptions</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "LLM Augmentation: For each retrieved listing, use the LLM to augment the description, tailoring it to resonate with the buyer’s specific preferences. This involves subtly emphasizing aspects of the property that align with what the buyer is looking for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maintaining Factual Integrity: Ensure that the augmentation process enhances the appeal of the listing without altering factual information.\n"
